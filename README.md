> An AI-powered Business Manager that combines deterministic business intelligence, multi-agent reasoning, and workflow automation to help small businesses make smarter operational decisions.

MerchantMind AI is a multi-agent AI platform that helps small businesses make smarter business decisions through autonomous AI agents.
